# Keylogger

A keylogger, short for “keystroke logger,” is a type of surveillance software or hardware that records every keystroke made on a specific computer or network without the user’s consent or knowledge. Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity or parental control, and malicious purposes, like stealing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

It is one of the most basic keylogger made by using pynput library of python.
